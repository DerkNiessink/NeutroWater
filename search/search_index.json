General Program Flow The software conducts a collision-driven Monte Carlo simulation, where it simulates each particle individually. Prior to running the simulation, it must undergo initialization, which involves the following steps: Interpolating the total, absorbtion, and scattering cross section data. Interpolating data of the initial energy distribution of the neutrons. Sampling the initial neutron energies from the energy distribution. Setting the initial position of the neutrons. Setting the position and size of the tank. The method of sampling from a distribution is described in Monte Carlo Sampling and the interpolation of distributions in Interpolation . After the initializing, the actual simulation of the diffusing neutrons can start. Each neutron's energy and position is updated consecutively which consists of the following steps: Give the neutron a random direction. Check if the neutron is inside the tank, if false end the loop else continue. Get the total cross section corresponding to the current energy of the neutron. Determine the nuclide with which the neutron collides. Compute the mean free path of the neutron and sample the distance to the next collision. Determine the type of reaction. If it is absorption, end the loop; if it is elastic scattering, proceed. Sample a direction from the angular distribution and compute the associated energy loss fraction. Update the Neutron's position and energy. Repeat steps 2-8 until the neutron either escaped or is absorbed. Positions and energies of the neutrons are stored. Several properties can be computed and measured from this data post-simulation.
