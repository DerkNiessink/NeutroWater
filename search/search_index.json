General Program Flow The software conducts a collision-driven Monte Carlo simulation, where it simulates each particle individually. Prior to running the simulation, it must undergo initialization, which involves the following steps: Interpolating the total, absorbtion, and scattering cross section data. Interpolating data of the initial energy distribution of the neutrons. Sampling the initial neutron energies from the energy distribution. Setting the initial position and energies of the neutrons. Setting the position and size of the tank. The initial spectrum is discussed in Spectrum , the method of sampling from a distribution is described in Monte Carlo Sampling , and the interpolation of distributions in Interpolation . After the initializing, the actual simulation of the diffusing neutrons can start. Each neutron's energy and position is updated consecutively which consists of the following steps: Give the neutron a random direction. Check if the neutron is inside the tank, if false end the loop else continue. Get the total cross section corresponding to the current energy of the neutron. Determine the nuclide with which the neutron collides. Compute the mean free path of the neutron and sample the distance to the next collision. Determine the type of reaction. If it is absorption, end the loop; if it is elastic scattering, proceed. Sample a direction from the angular distribution and compute the associated energy loss fraction. Update the Neutron's position and energy. Repeat steps 2-8 until the neutron either escaped or is absorbed. Positions and energies of the neutrons are stored. Several properties can be computed and measured from this data post-simulation. Each step is discussed in more detail in the following sections: Steps Section 2 Geometry 3-4 Cross Sections 5 Distance To Next Collision 6 Cross Sections 7-8 Transforming Coordinates 2. Neutron Physics 2.1 Initial Energy Spectrum 2.2 Cross Sections The cross section indicates the likelihood of a particular interaction occurring between two particles. It is influenced by two main factors: the types of particles involved and their energies. In our scenario, there are two possible combinations of particles in an interaction: a neutron with an H-nucleus and a neutron with an O-nucleus. Unfortunately, it's not possible to calculate the cross section as a function of energy analytically. However, there is an abundance of freely accessible nuclear data available to everyone. In the program cross section data from ENDF/B is used an interpolated following the procedure outlined in Interpolation . In various reactions, different cross sections are involved. To proceed, we employ the following notations: Notation Description $\\sigma_{H, tot}, \\sigma_{O, tot}, \\sigma_{H_2O, tot}$ Total cross section for the specified nuclide. $\\sigma_{H, s}, \\sigma_{O, s}$ Scattering cross section for the specified nuclide. $\\sigma_{H, a}, \\sigma_{O, a}$ Absorption cross section for the specified nuclide. $\\Sigma_{H_2O}$, \\Sigma_{H}, \\Sigma_{O}$ Total macroscopic for the specified nuclide or molecule. The theory behind these reactions is described in detail in Neutron Interactions . For each type of cross section of the nuclides there are separate datafiles. Total macroscopic cross section for a molecule can be computed as follows: $$\\Sigma = \\sum_i N_i \\sigma_i $$, where N_i is the atomic density of atoms of type $i$: $$ N_i = \\frac{\\rho N_a}{M} n_i $$, where $\\rho$ is the density of the compound, $M$ the molecular weight, $N_a$ Avogrado's constant, and $n_i$ the number of atoms of type i in the molecule. Thus, the total macrocscopic cross section for $H_2O$ is given by: $$\\Sigma = \\frac{\\rho_{H_20} N_a}{M_{H_20}} (2 \\sigma_{H, t} + \\sigma_{O, t})$$. 2.3 Neutron Interactions 2.4 Distance to Next Collision 2.5 Transforming Coordinates 2.6 Thermal Motion 3 Geometry 4 Monte Carlo Sampling 5 Interpolation","title":"Theory and Methodology"},{"location":"theory/#theory-and-methodology","text":"","title":"Theory and Methodology"},{"location":"theory/#1-general-program-flow","text":"The software conducts a collision-driven Monte Carlo simulation, where it simulates each particle individually.
